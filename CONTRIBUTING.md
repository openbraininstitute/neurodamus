# Contribution Guide for External Users

We would love for you to contribute to the neurodamus project and help make it better than it is today.
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#got-a-question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#found-a-bug)
 - [Feature Requests](#missing-a-feature)
 - [Submissions](#submission-guidelines)
 - [Development Guidelines](#development)
 - [Release Procedure](#release)

# Got a Question?

Please do not hesitate to raise an issue on [github project page][github].

# Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#issues)
to our [GitHub Repository][github].

However, before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem
already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce
and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will need as much information as possible, and
preferably with an example.

#  Missing a Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#issues) to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your
work first, to be sure that we can use it.
